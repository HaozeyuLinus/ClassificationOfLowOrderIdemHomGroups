# ClassificationOfLowOrderIdemHomGroups
The Code is used to help classify lower order idempotent hom-groups
## These codes are attached to the paper "on the classification of lower order idempotent hom-groups". 

A file beginning with "recog" indicates that the code is used to find out the structure that constitutes a idempotent hom-group, "Xorder" indicates that the order of the idempotent hom-groups being processed is X, and the number followed by "Xorder" indicates several parts in the corresponding paper. A file beginning with "iso" indicates that the code is used to find the isomorphic class.

The code is opened using Matlab(.m file), and after running, all the results can be obtained in the "result" of the working space.

under the premise of the computer configuration: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-13500H   2.60 GHz and 16 GB RAM, most of the code can run the result instantly, but the last code of the 4-order idempotent hom-group ("recog4order4" and "iso4order4") will run about 17 hours (require some patience). One effective way to increase efficiency is to use Mathematica to write code. 

We rewrote this part of the Code in Mathematica14(.nb file), and it only took about 4 hours to run. The code is opened using Mathematica(.nb file), and after running, all the results will be printed on the screen.
