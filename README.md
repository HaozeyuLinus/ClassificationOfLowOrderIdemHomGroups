# ClassificationOfLowOrderIdemHomGroups
Code for auxiliary classification of lower order idempotent hom-groups
## These codes are attached to the paper "on the classification of lower order idempotent hom-groups". 

A file beginning with "recog" indicates that the code is used to find out the structure that constitutes a idempotent hom-group, "3order" indicates that the structure that constitutes a idempotent hom-group of order 3, "4order" indicates that the structure that constitutes a idempotent hom-group of order 4, and the number followed by "4order" indicates several categories in the corresponding paper. A file beginning with "iso" indicates that the code is used to find the isomorphic class in it.

The code is opened using Matlab, and after running, all the results can be obtained in the "result" of the working space.
